I'm a Junior web developer and game designer from the Midwest with a passion for the creative process in multiple mediums. 
During my studies, I gained practical and foundational industry knowledge in modern web development using tools/frameworks 
such as Bootstrap, NodeJS, MySQL, React, and Motoko for Blockchain apps. I also enjoy building free-to-play games using Unity,
written in C#. My creativity, passion for problem-solving, and continuous learning have led me to fall in love with programming. 

When I'm not working on a new idea for a game or web app, I enjoy spending my free time on Photography and Videography.
